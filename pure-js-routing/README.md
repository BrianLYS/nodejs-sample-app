# How to run

1. Run `node server.js`
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000/`

## Server.js
It's a simple node.js server that serves index.html and about.html files with 'http' module.
When req url is '/', it serves index.html, switch case is used to serve about.html when req url is '/about'.

## Smth.js
It's just a random file where I tested the function before placing into index.html file.
